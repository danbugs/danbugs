### Hello, there ðŸ‘‹

Name's Dan.

I work Microsoft on a project called Hyperlight. You can learn more about it [here](https://youtu.be/Tz2SOjKZwVA?feature=shared). Previously, I worked on [SpiderLightning/`slight`](https://github.com/deislabs/spiderlightning).

I am a champion to [7 WASI proposals](https://github.com/WebAssembly/WASI/blob/main/Proposals.md): `wasi:http`, `wasi;keyvalue`, `wasi:config`, `wasi:blobstore`, `wasi-distributed-lock-service`, `wasi:messaging`, and `wasi:sql`.

I love helping people learn! Here are some of the things I am doing:
    - I teach people Rust/Wasm on my [YouTube Channel - danlogs](https://www.youtube.com/c/danlogs).
    - I am working with Manning on publishing a book for Wasm on the server-side. The book's code is partially available [here](https://github.com/danbugs/serverside-wasm-book-code).
    - I am working with Udacity on an intro to Rust course.

On my free-time, I like playing Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and watching Star Trek.

Here's a fun stat:
